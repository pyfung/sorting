Yes, I am the author of that (infamous?) ["I can't believe it can sort" paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01111).

No, I'm not supplying a "reference implementation" here. Don't be silly.

For now this is just a placeholder to [link to a page](https://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/pyfung/sorting.html) where I made additional comments about the paper (which otherwise has become an orphan and not linked to from anywhere else).
