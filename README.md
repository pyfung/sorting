Yes, I am the author of that (infamous?) ["I can't believe it can sort" paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01111).

No, I'm not supplying a "reference implementation" here. Don't be silly.

For now this is just a placeholder to link to pages where I made [additional comments about the paper](https://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/pyfung/sorting.html), tried to explain [why that algorithm is NOT bubble sort](https://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/pyfung/notbubble.html), and collected [people's reactions about the algorithm](https://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/pyfung/sorting_responses.html).
